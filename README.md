I developed a machine learning model to predict airline ticket prices based on features like departure time, duration, number of stops, and airline type. The workflow included extensive data preprocessing, EDA, feature engineering, and model selection using regression techniques in Python. I evaluated model performance using RMSE and RÂ² scores, with the Random Forest model yielding the best results. The project demonstrates how data science can improve pricing transparency in the travel industry.
